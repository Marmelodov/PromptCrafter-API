# OpenAPI Specification

The PromptCrafter API OpenAPI Specification provides a complete, machine-readable contract for every endpoint in the PromptCrafter API. Use this specification to generate client libraries, explore the API structure, or integrate with tools like Swagger UI for interactive documentation.

> **Note:** The PromptCrafter API server is now offline. This specification documents the API as it was implemented and tested. Any generated clients or tools will not be able to make live requests, but you can still review endpoints, data models, and error-handling scenarios.

## How to use the OpenAPI Specification

1. Download the OpenAPI YAML file from the link below.
2. Open a tool like [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Redocly](https://redocly.com/) that supports OpenAPI imports.
3. Import the downloaded YAML file to view the interactive API documentation, generate code snippets, or create client SDKs.
4. Explore the endpoints, schemas, and examples directly in the tool.

The specification includes detailed schemas, request/response examples, authentication details, and comprehensive error handling.
