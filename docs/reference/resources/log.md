# `log` resource

Resource endpoint:

```text
https://promptcrafter-production.up.railway.app/logs
```

The `log` resource stores the output generated by a [`prompt`](prompt.md) when tested with a specific AI model. It includes the output itself, the AI model used, optional user notes, a user-assigned score, and the creation timestamp. All operations on the log resource require user authentication with a bearer token.
