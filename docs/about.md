# Project background

PromptCrafter API was originally developed as a capstone project for the University of Washington Specialization in API Documentation. The project uses the same tools, workflows, and developer-focused approach found in professional API documentation environments.

The API, documentation, and supporting tools were all developed to demonstrate best practices for clear, useful, and maintainable developer documentation.
