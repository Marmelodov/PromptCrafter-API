# PromptCrafter API

## Store prompts, log results, and review performance

**PromptCrafter API is a REST API for managing generative AI prompts.** Built for developers, prompt engineers, and researchers, it enables you to maintain a structured prompt library, log and score outputs, and evaluate performance across models.

- **Save and manage prompts:** Store, update, and organize prompts with titles, content, model specifications, and tags.  
- **Log and score outputs:** Record outputs from different models, add notes, and rate their performance for systematic testing.  
- **Search your library:** Instantly find prompts with full-text search across titles, content, and tags.
