# Tutorials

These tutorials provide a hands-on, guided path through the core capabilities of the PromptCrafter API. Follow them to learn how to build a powerful, organized, and performance-tested prompt library from the ground up.

Each tutorial focuses on a key task, takes 5-15 minutes to complete, and includes ready-to-use code examples.

### What you'll learn

* How to create, update, and manage a library of reusable prompts.
* How to systematically test prompts and log their outputs for analysis.
* How to search your library to find the exact prompts you need for any task.

### 1. Authentication and First Steps

This is the first step for new users.

* **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)**: Create an account, receive a JWT for authentication, and save your first prompt in under five minutes.

### 2. Building and Organizing a Prompt Library

These guides teach the fundamental operations for managing a library of prompts.

* **[Save a prompt](tutorials/create-prompt.md)**: Add a new, reusable prompt to your library.
* **[Search for prompts](tutorials/search-prompts.md)**: Locate specific prompts using keyword search on titles, content, and tags.
* **[Update a prompt](tutorials/update-prompt.md)**: Modify an existing prompt's content, title, AI model, or organizational tags.

### 3. Testing and Analysis

These guides explain how to log outputs and retrieve them for analysis.

* **[Log a generated output](tutorials/test-prompt.md)**: Store the output from a prompt test, along with contextual notes and a performance score.
* **[View logs](tutorials/view-logs.md)**: Retrieve test results for a specific prompt to compare outputs and refine instructions.
