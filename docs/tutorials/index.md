# Tutorials

Tutorials give you step-by-step instructions for common tasks after you've completed the Quickstart. Each focuses on a single endpoint, shows the request and expected response, and explains next steps. They assume you already have a bearer token and either Postman or cURL. Each takes 5-15 minutes to complete.  

- [Quickstart](../quickstart.md): Create an account, log in, and save your first prompt
- [Save a prompt](create-prompt.md): Store a new prompt with `POST /prompts`
- [Log a generated output](test-prompt.md): Record a prompt’s output, notes, and score with `POST /logs`
- [View logs](view-logs.md): Retrieve stored test results with `GET /logs`
- [Search prompts](search-prompts.md): Locate prompts by keyword using `GET /search?q=`
