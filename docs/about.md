# About PromptCrafter API

PromptCrafter API is a backend REST API for storing, organizing, and evaluating generative AI prompts. It's designed for developers, prompt engineers, and anyone working with generative AI who needs to maintain a structured library of prompts, track changes and performance, and integrate prompt data into external tools and apps.

While the live API server is currently offline, this documentation site presents API documentation, developer reference, and SDK documentation for a fully functional API. The project demonstrates industry best practices in API reference, developer onboarding, and technical communication.

## Who is PromptCrafter for?

- **Developers** building or integrating generative AI tools and apps.
- **Prompt engineers** iterating on and optimizing prompts.
- **Researchers** tracking prompt performance across different AI models.
- Anyone who needs an easy way to organize and retrieve reusable prompts.

## What does PromptCrafter provide?

## Project background

PromptCrafter API was originally developed as a capstone project for the University of Washington Specialization in API Documentation. The project uses the same tools, workflows, and developer-focused approach found in professional API documentation environments.

The API, documentation, and supporting tools were all developed to demonstrate best practices for clear, useful, and maintainable developer documentation.
