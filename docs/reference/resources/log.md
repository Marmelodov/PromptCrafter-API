# API Reference: `log` resource

The `log` resource stores the output generated by a `prompt` when tested with a specific AI model. It includes the output itself, the AI model used, optional user notes, a user-assigned score, and the creation timestamp. All operations on the `log` resource require user authentication with a bearer token.
