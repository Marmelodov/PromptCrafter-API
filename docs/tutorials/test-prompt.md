# Tutorial: Log a generated output

This tutorial shows how to test a saved prompt by logging its output. The tutorial takes about 5-10 minutes.

## Before you start

Make sure you have:

- A PromptCrafter user account and the bearer token you received when you logged in. For help signing up or logging in, see the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md).
- cURL or Postman.  

## Choose a prompt to test

To retrieve your saved prompts, send a `GET /prompts` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {your_token}" \
  https://promptcrafter-production.up.railway.app/prompts
```

Find the `_id` of the prompt you want to test.

## Prepare the log data

The request body for a log includes the prompt ID and the output you want to save. You can also add optional notes and a score, such as 1-10.

- `promptId`: the `_id` of the tested prompt  
- `output`: the text generated by the model  
- `modelUsed`: the model that generated the output  
- `notes`: (optional) your comments on the result  
- `score`: (optional) your rating of the output  

Example:

```json
{
  "promptId": "prompt104",
  "output": "The Industrial Revolution transformed how people lived and worked by introducing inventions like the steam engine and the spinning jenny. These technologies allowed factories to produce goods faster, making everyday items cheaper and more accessible for families throughout Europe and America.",
  "notes": "Clear, accessible explanation for students.",
  "modelUsed": "Claude 3 Sonnet",
  "score": 8
}
```

## Send the request

Use this endpoint:  
`https://promptcrafter-production.up.railway.app/logs`

Include these headers:

- `Authorization: Bearer {your_token}`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

### Using cURL

```bash
curl -X POST https://promptcrafter-production.up.railway.app/logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "promptId": "prompt104",
    "output": "The Industrial Revolution transformed how people lived and worked by introducing inventions like the steam engine and the spinning jenny. These technologies allowed factories to produce goods faster, making everyday items cheaper and more accessible for families throughout Europe and America.",
    "notes": "Clear, accessible explanation for students.",
    "modelUsed": "Claude 3 Sonnet",
    "score": 8
  }'
```

### Using Postman

1. Open Postman  
2. Set method to `POST`  
3. Set URL to:  
   `https://promptcrafter-production.up.railway.app/logs`
4. In the **Authorization** tab:  
   - Type: Bearer Token  
   - Token: `{your_token}`  
5. In the **Headers** tab:  
   - Key: `Content-Type`  
   - Value: `application/json`  
6. In the **Body** tab:  
   - Choose `raw` and `JSON`  
   - Paste the JSON from the example above  
7. Click **Send**

## Check the response

If request is successful, the server returns a `201 Created` response like this:

```json
{
  "_id": "log104",
  "promptId": "prompt104",
  "output": "The Industrial Revolution transformed how people lived and worked by introducing inventions like the steam engine and the spinning jenny. These technologies allowed factories to produce goods faster, making everyday items cheaper and more accessible for families throughout Europe and America.",
  "notes": "Clear, accessible explanation for students.",
  "modelUsed": "Claude 3 Sonnet",
  "score": 8,
  "createdAt": "2024-06-20T13:13:00Z"
}
```

To confirm that the log saved correctly, retrieve all logs:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {your_token}" \
  https://promptcrafter-production.up.railway.app/logs
```

## What to do if the request doesn't work

Use this table to check what went wrong:

| Status Code                | What it means                  | What to check                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400 Bad Request           | The request wasn't valid        | Make sure you included `promptId`, `output`, and `modelUsed` |
| 401 Unauthorized          | You're not logged in            | Check your bearer token for typos or expiration             |
| 403 Forbidden             | Not allowed                     | You may not own the prompt you're testing                   |
| 404 Not Found             | Prompt doesn't exist            | Check that the prompt ID is correct                         |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Server problem                  | Try again later or contact support                          |
